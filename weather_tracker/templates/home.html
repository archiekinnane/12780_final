<h1>Whither the Weather?</h1>
<br>

<p> This site helps explore how local climate conditions are changing 
    over time by comparing recent weather metrics against historical 
    baselines.</p>    
    <br>

<p> Right now, the two metrics you can look at are days greater than 90F 
    and days less than 32F as compared to a baseline period. 
More metrics can be added in the future.</p>
<br>

<p>Users can submit queries for specific locations, metrics, 
    and time periods. Submitted queries are stored but not yet completed automatically. 
    Automated completion and calculation of results can be added with 
    Open-Meteo API integration, but this programmer didn't have time to do that.
    So it's seeded with data for the 15 largest cities in the US 
    for the last 10 years and users can also manually submit weather data.

<p>The dashboard provides some interactive visualizations.</p>
